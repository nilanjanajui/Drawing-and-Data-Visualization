## variables
x = 13.8
# print variable
print(x)


## Constants
name <- "John" 
age <- 40

## printing the variables in console
name # auto-print the value of the variable
age

print(name) # print the value of the variable
print(age)


## Concatenate Elements
my_text <- "awesome"
print(paste("R is", my_text))

## We can also use "," to add a variable to another variable:
text1 <- "R is"
text2 <- "awesome"
paste(text1, text2)

## For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

num1 <- 5
num2 <- 10

num1 + num2


# Assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
var1 <- var2 <- var3 <- "Orange"

# Print variable values
var1
var2
var3



## A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or 
# a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). 
## Rules for R variables are:
## A variable name must start with a letter and can be a combination of letters, digits, period(.)
# and underscore(_). If it starts with period(.), it cannot be followed by a digit.
##A variable name cannot start with a number or underscore (_)
## Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
## Reserved words cannot be used as variables (TRUE, FALSE, NULL, if...)
